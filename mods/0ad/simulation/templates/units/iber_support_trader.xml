    <History>Iberian merchants traded among themselves and had access to larger markets through Carthaginian ports such a Cartegena. Using wagons and carts, the traders also plied wares to Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans who came to the Iberian Peninsula. Oil, wine, slaves, wool, and wheat were all exported by the Iberians, but most prized of all were its fine horses and remarkably pure iron, which made the finest swords of the ancient world.</History>
